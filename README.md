Chinese Poker Score
-------------------

An iOS app that keeps score of 2,3 or 4 player [Chinese Poker game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poker).

This app is my exploration to the new ways of Xcode 5 and XCTest framework and their best practices. Initially it will be developed with iOS 7 in mind, afterwards support for older versions might get added.

### Features (planned)

1. Very easy to enter scores (tapping, no typing)
2. Keep track of previously played games and their scores
3. Personalise players (add names to them)
